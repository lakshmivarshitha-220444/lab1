<p> Dr. Danny Coward has worked on all editions of the Java platform. He led the 
definition of Java Servlets into the first version of the Java EE platform and 
beyond, web services into the Java ME platform, and the strategy and planning 
for Java SE 7. He founded JavaFX technology and, most recently, designed the 
largest addition to the Java EE 7 standard, the Java WebSocket API. From 
coding in Java, to designing APIs with industry experts, to serving for several 
years as an executive to the Java Community Process, he has a uniquely broad 
perspective into multiple aspects of Java technology. In addition, he is the 
author of two books on Java programming: Java WebSocket Programming and 
Java EE 7: The Big Picture. Most recently, he has been applying his knowledge 
of Java to helping scale massive Java-based services for one of the world’s most 
successful software companies. Dr. Coward holds a bachelor’s, master’s, and 
doctorate in mathematics from the University of Oxford</p>
